# Desktop state subscriptions

The desktop host consumes Knave API 1.2 via one dedicated `DesktopSubscription`.
The first frame initializes state; every later frame replaces it. There is no
healthy-connection timer or query loop. The existing one-entry UI mailbox and
Wayland wake channel coalesce updates. Commands and preview requests use their
own connections. Subscription events do not wait for a preview response.

Close interrupts the socket read and joins the worker. Failed connections report
an explicit error and reconnect with 250 ms to 5 s backoff; idle connections have
no receive timeout. Reconnect always processes a new initial snapshot and
invalidates previews, including when the new compositor reuses generation IDs.
A connection in its initial handshake can take up to the existing two-second
transport timeout to cancel. The old 500 ms polling fallback is removed.

This requires Villain with desktop API 1.2. Older servers report an error, not
fabricated empty state or a silent polling fallback. Roll out Knave API, Villain,
then shell; roll back shell first. Existing Application callbacks and user
configuration are unchanged. The API pin also includes the upstream API 1.1
maximized summary field. No frame pacing or pixel-damage streaming is added.

## Measurement

A live Wayland host probe on 2026-09-27 received pushed snapshots, survived a
connection drop and a reconnect with the same generation, restored a minimized
window through the separate command connection, and exited cleanly while the
subscription was idle. The service observed two subscription handshakes and
zero snapshot queries, including a three-second idle interval. This exercises
the host transport and lifecycle with a controlled service; it does not establish
direct-TTY frame latency or pixel-preview freshness. Workspace transition IPC
latency and subscriber resource measurements are recorded in Villain's companion
architecture note. No unit-test suite was run for this change.
